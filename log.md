# Day 1:
- I forked the repository and started my journey.
- The problem was taken from hackerrank.com 
- To solve this problem I have used ArrayList class in Java (to search if ArrayList contains the specified integer)
# Day 2:
- I have tried to solve some problems from hackerrank (most of them was wrong:( )
- I complete only one of them, which was about constructing the number divisible by 3 from array elements
